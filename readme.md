Jetpack compose tinder like card stack. Library supports Compose Multiplatform.

## Installing

### Android

Add the dependencies:

```kotlin
implementation("io.github.hukumister:lazycardstack-android:0.0.2")
```

### Multi-platform

Add the dependency to the common source-set:

```kotlin
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        commonMain {
            dependencies {
                implementation("io.github.hukumister:lazycardstack:0.0.2")
                // ...
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Demo 

Wait a bit, the gif for the demo is quite large and may take a long time to load:

## How to use?

The library has an API similar to LazyColumn.

```kotlin
val cardStackState = rememberLazyCardStackState()
LazyCardStack(
    modifier = Modifier
        .padding(24.dp)
        .fillMaxSize(),
    state = cardStackState
) {
    items(
        items = list.value,
        key = { it.hashCode() }
    ) { text ->
        TextCard(
            modifier = Modifier
                .background(Color.White),
            text = text
        )
    }

    item(
        key = { "loading" }
    ) {
        Text(
            modifier = Modifier
                .padding(16.dp)
                .fillMaxSize(),
            text = "Loading..."
        )
    }
}
```

The `LazyCardStackState` gives you access to the card's _offset_ so that you can create
advanced animations according to the amount of swiping done.


## How to swipe programmatically?

```kotlin

val state = rememberLazyCardStackState()
val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()

Button(
    onClick = {
        scope.launch { cardStackState.animateToNext(SwipeDirection.Right) }
    }
) {
    Text("Like")
}
```

The `animateToNext()` suspend function will return, as soon as the swipe animation is finished.

You can also specify specific animation settings for swipe:
```kotlin

val state = rememberLazyCardStackState()
val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()

scope.launch {
    cardStackState.animateToNext(
        direction = SwipeDirection.Right,
        animation = tween(500)
    )
}
```

## How to detect that a card has been swiped away?

LazyCardStack has a callback that will be called after swiping the card:

```kotlin
LazyCardStack(
    onSwipedItem = { index, direction -> 
        // handle swipe
    },
    state = cardStackState
)
```

## Can I return previous card?

Indeed, `LazyCardStackState` gives you method to return previous card:

```kotlin

val state = rememberLazyCardStackState()
val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()

scope.launch {
    cardStackState.animateToBack(SwipeDirection.Up)
}

```

you must specify the direction from which the animation of returning the card will occur.
